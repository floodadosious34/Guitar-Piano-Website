# Guitar Piano Website
I created a website to offer my services teaching guitar, and tuning pianos. There are 4 pages for the website: Home, About, Services, and Contact. I designed the website in a mobile first method. There are 2 primary media queries to adjust the layout of the website to accomodate mobile and desktop devices.

## Features Included
1. CSS feature Navigation menu that expands and collapes properly at desktop and mobile size, switches from hamburger menu to nav
2. JavaScript feature-Created an object that has multiple values in it, those values are put into a for loop then displayed on the screen
3. Flexbox is used to organize the content of the pages to display properly in mobile and desktop views
4. A contact form uses javascript to take the input and validate it. I used an alert box to let the user know that they filled out the form correctly. The website will show the user the alert with their name in the message. if filled out incorrectly they will get an error alert message.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the root folder of the project.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
